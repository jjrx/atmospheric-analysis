  <h1>Examining how air quality affects asthma</h1>

  <img src="images/grouppicture.png" width="500" />

  <p>The purpose of the project was to see if there exists a correlation between air pollution and frequency of asthma.</p>
  <p>Environmental data was acquired via the EPA API and emergency department visits for asthma in California data was acquired from the California Health and Human Services.</p>

  <h3>Atmospheric parameters</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li>AQI - air quality index</li> 
    <li>Ozone - concentration of ground-level ozone (ppb)</li> 
    <li>PM2.5 - concentration of PM2.5</li> 
  </ul>
